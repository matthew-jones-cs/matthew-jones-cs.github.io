                <h3>Meeting the Specifications</h3>
                <p>There are 3 diffrent ways I use interactive Java Script in my client project. The first way is my dynamic headers and footers. I only have the header and footer of this website writen in one place, in a components file. Java Script loads these files onto each of the pages of this website. I also use Java Script for the gallery. In this gallery, I, by default, display many lower quality versions of photos taken by my client. Once one of these photos is clicked, the gallery/slideshow pops up. This slideshow uses higher quality photos showing the detail of the photos. I use Java Script to change the src of the photo being displayed depending on the input you choose. My third way of using Java Script in my client project is input encoding. When a user puts an input into the forms that contains characters that could manipulate the code, it is encoded. This use of Java Script makes it so that the code would not execute. Once the input is encoded, an alert pops up telling the user that their input was encoded.</p>                
                <p>I followed the CRAP principles by:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>C: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Picking colors that contrast well that eventually passed the validation (it took me many iterations of diffrent colors to pass this validation).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>R:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Put elements that repeat over pages in the same spots (i.e, the header and footer).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>A:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Aligned all things in a proper and set way.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>P:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Made relating items close to each other.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Feedback</h3>
                <p>I did not make any changes to my website because Edwin, the only person who gave me advice, told me that there was no real problem with the website. Because of that, I do not think that I need to make any changes. However, Edwin did state that I had some unused real estate on my website. Because of that, I will further discuss with my client potential changes to the website.</p>

                <h3>My Evaluation</h3>
                <p>I think that my website will completley meet my clients need's. I meet all the requirements of the project, and I fulfilled all of my client's requirements for the webpage. My future plans for this website are to update the site as my client desires and to add more functionality to the site as my client desires.</p>
