                <li>Can you navigate to this page?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yes you can navigate to the client project.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Course file and folder naming conventions are followed
                    <ul>
                        <li>Although it is not common on this page some capital letters are used in folder names. It does not look like a big problem and looks easy to fix.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Design
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contrast and appropriate font sizing
                            <ul>
                                <li>I think the contrast looks fine. The colors chosen contrast well with each other. Additionally, according to WAVE the contrast and font are appropriate (though there are h2 warnings).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Website has its own CSS file
                            <ul>
                                <li>This website does have its own CSS file.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Follows the CRAP principals

                                <li>Contrast
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>As mentioned above the contrast of this website is good, and additionally, according to WAVE, there is nothing wrong with the contrast.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Although the mistakes are small there are some things that move around the page as you click through the site.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Alignment
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>I think this page aligns its elements well. I see no real mistakes here.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The nav bar and other related elements of this page are grouped together.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                        <li>Footer
                            <ul>
                                <li>The page contains a footer.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Site has a header and a propper h1
                    <ul>
                        <li>The site does have a header section, and does use the h1 tag properly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Main starts with an h2 and has correct content
                    <ul>
                        <li>Main does start with an h2 tag, but this h2 tag does not contain the correct content. This is a simple fix. The h2 should not have the site name/brand in the h2, which this one does.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The page has a tagline somewhere
                    <ul>
                        <li>I do not observe any tag lines on this page, but I could of missed it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Validation
                    <ul>
                        <li>No HTML or css validation links are on the page. Just include the accumulus script in the head tag and you will be set.</li>
                    </ul>
