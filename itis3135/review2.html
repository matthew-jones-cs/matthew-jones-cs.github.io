                <li>Can you navigate to this page?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yes you can navigate to the client project.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Course file and folder naming conventions are followed
                    <ul>
                        <li>It looks link all course relevant file nameing conventions are being followed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Design
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contrast and appropriate font sizing
                            <ul>
                                <li>I think the contrast looks fine. The colors chosen contrast well with each other. Additionally, according to WAVE the contrast and font are appropriate (though there are css, html, and image warnings).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Website has its own CSS file
                            <ul>
                                <li>This website does have its own CSS file.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Follows the CRAP principals
                            <ul>
                                <li>Contrast
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Again the contrast of this page is good, colors are distinct from each other, and additionally, according to WAVE, there is nothing wrong with the contrast.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Repetition
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>As I clicked through the site nothing changed its position to much if at all (I saw no movment in elements that are across all pages of the site).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Alignment
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>I think this page aligns its elements well. I see no real mistakes here.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Proximity
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The nav bar and other related elements of this page are grouped together.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Page components
                    <ul>
                        <li>Header
                            <ul>
                                <li>The page contains a header.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Main
                            <ul>
                                <li>The page contains a main.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Footer
                            <ul>
                                <li>The page contains a footer.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Site has a header and a proper h1
                    <ul>
                        <li>The site does have a header section, but does not apear to have an h1 tag.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Main starts with an h2 and has correct content
                    <ul>
                        <li>Main does exist, but the h2 tag comes before the main. This is a simple fix. the h2 should not have the site name/brand in the h2, which this one does.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The site has a tagline somewhere
                    <ul>
                        <li>I believe this site has a tagline,.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Validation
                    <ul>
                        <li>This page does have validation, but it also has a couple html, css, and image warnings. The validation is only on the home page though. The images just need to be resized to resolve this warning. And a h3 tag is all that needs to be added to fix the html warning.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
