                    <li>Contrast: The contrast of this page is great. Everything on this page contrasts well. When text is in front of images it is easy to read, and understand.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: Each page linked on this site has a similar feel, and color scheme in some regard. All pages look good.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: Everything is in some order and looks well where it is on the page.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: Elements are not fighting for space on the page. There are diffrent sections for different topics.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu">Yale Art</a></h3>
                <p>This is an art page for Yale University.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: Seome sections on this page have decent contrast while other sections have terrible contrast.</li>
                    <li>Repetition: The page has repetition in the sense that each page it links to looks bad. Some elements are in similar spaces, but most colors and background are changed/different.</li>
                    <li>Alignment: This page is best at alignment, though it is not great at even that.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: The proximity of this page is terrible. Elements are all over the place and sections have no clear beginning or end.</li>
