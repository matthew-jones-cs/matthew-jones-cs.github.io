            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Majestic Jumping Spider Pocket Watches! Here at Majestic Jumping Spider Pocket Watches we sell, you guessed it pocket watches. But we do not sell just any pocket watches. We sell pocket watches that are always just a bit off. When we say off we do not mean time wise. What would be the point in a watch company that sell watches that are off? Our pocket watches are a just little to big, a tad to small, a little to expencive. or they might even tick to loud.</p>
            <p>We offer a great product for a variable price.</p>
